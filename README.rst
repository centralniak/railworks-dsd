Hardware driver security device for Train Simulator 2015


Supported traction
------------------

**railworks-dsd** has been positively tested with the following vehicles.

* Class 70
* Class 90 (Armstrong Powerhouse and Steam versions)
* Class 220 (JustTrains version)
* Class 221 (JustTrains version)

Even if your favorite loco is not listed it's highly probable that it's supported as long as it does not have a built-in
Driver Security Device in which case it needs to be handled in a special way.
